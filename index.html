                    <h3>Timeline</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Born in 1963: </strong>in Knoxville, Tennessee, the only child of Connie McHugh and
                            aspiring actor Tony Tarantino, who left the family before his son's birth. His father is of
                            Italian descent, and his mother has Cherokee and Irish ancestry. He was named in part for
                            Quint Asper, Burt Reynolds' character in the CBS series Gunsmoke. Tarantino's mother met his
                            father during a trip to Los Angeles, where Tony was a law student and would-be entertainer.
                            After a brief marriage and divorce, Connie Tarantino left Los Angeles and moved to
                            Knoxville, where her parents lived. In 1966, Tarantino and his mother returned to Los
                            Angeles.</li>

                            <strong>Late 1970s: </strong>In 1986, Tarantino was employed in his first Hollywood job,
                            working with Roger Avary as production assistants on Dolph Lundgren's exercise video,
                            Maximum Potential. The following year, he played an Elvis impersonator in "Sophia's Wedding:
                            Part 1", an episode in the fourth season of The Golden Girls, which was broadcast on
                            November 19, 1988. Tarantino recalled in 2020 that the pay he received from that part helped
                            finance Reservoir Dogs; he estimated he initially was paid about $600, but since the episode
                            was frequently rerun because it was on a "best of..." lineup, he received about $3,000 in
                            residuals over three years.

                            <strong>1990s: </strong>In 1998, Tarantino made his major Broadway stage debut as an amoral psycho killer in a revival of the 1966 play Wait Until Dark, which received unfavorable reviews from critics, but his star power ensured a nearly sold-out production for its limited, 16-week Broadway run. In December 1999, Tarantino was attached to a film adaptation of the Marvel comic Iron Man for New Line Cinema. Nothing came of the project. Throughout the 1990s, Tarantino had a number of minor acting roles, including in Eddie Presley (1992), The Coriolis Effect (1994), Sleep With Me (1994), Somebody to Love (1994), All-American Girl (1995), Destiny Turns on the Radio (1995), Desperado (1995), From Dusk till Dawn (1996), and Girl 6 (1996). He also starred in Steven Spielberg's Director's Chair, a simulation video game that uses pre-generated film clips.

                            <strong>2000s: </strong> Tarantino's film Inglourious Basterds, released in 2009, is the story of a group of Jewish-American guerrilla soldiers in Nazi-occupied France during World War II. Filming began in October 2008. The film opened on August 21, 2009, to very-positive reviews and reached the #1 spot at the box office worldwide. It went on to become Tarantino's highest-grossing film until it was surpassed by Django Unchained three years later. For the film, Tarantino received his second nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director and Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.

                            <strong>2010s: </strong>On July 11, 2017, it was reported that Tarantino's next project would be a film about the Manson Family murders.[ In February 2018, it was announced that the film's title would be Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, and that Leonardo DiCaprio would play Rick Dalton, a fictional star of television Westerns, with Brad Pitt as Dalton's longtime stunt double Cliff Booth. Tarantino wrote the screenplay for the film. Margot Robbie also starred as real life actress Sharon Tate, portrayed as Dalton's next-door neighbor. Among the film's supporting cast were Timothy Olyphant, Kurt Russell, Michael Madsen and Al Pacino. Filming took place in the summer of 2018. In wake of the Harvey Weinstein sexual abuse allegations, Tarantino severed ties to The Weinstein Company permanently and sought a new distributor after working with Weinstein for his entire career. The film officially premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival, where it was in competition for the Palme d'Or. It received positive reviews at the festival, with praise for DiCaprio, Pitt and Robbie, although reactions were mixed regarding the ending of the film. It received a seven-minute standing ovation, although it did not win in any category. Sony Pictures distributed the film, which was theatrically released on July 26, 2019.
